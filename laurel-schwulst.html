                    <div>Laurel Schwulst is a designer, artist, writer, educator, and technologist. She is recognized
                        for her experiential projects-as-worlds, her expanded writing practice, her creative direction
                        leadership, her websites, her innovative learning materials and educational environments, and
                        her ongoing collaborations. Her writing (published in venues including <span

                            The

                        perfume reviews, and
                        interviews with other artists. For over a decade, she has taught award-winning design classes
                        and workshops (at universities including Yale and Princeton), and has presented internationally
                        at cultural, academic, and internet-native institutions (at venues including BBC Radio 4, RISD,
                        University of Seoul, Google, and Wikipedia). Laurel currently lives in New York City, serves as
                        director of the gift shop at Are.na (a platform for networked curation), and is working towards
                        a “PBS of the Internet.”</div>
                    <div>As an instructor and internet designer, Laurel’s thinking has played a major role in my work.
                        Her unique perspective and lightness towards her practice is admirable. She can think deeply
                        about the world while doing it in a playful way. Her vision of the future is refreshing in a
                        time with so much uncertainty, but her love for humanity is what I find most intriguing. She
                        doesn’t take herself too seriously, but in doing so has so much depth and breadth. After our
                        conversation, I asked Laurel if she’d like to contribute a song for the mixtape that comes with
                        the book. Her choice was <span class="italic-text">Your Wildlife</span> by Propaganda.</div>

                    <div>Noise is about ambience and the environment. It’s interesting to think about the difference
                        between sound and noise. Not that I have a very big definition myself, but to me, sound seems
                        more general than noise. It somehow feels more atmospheric.</div>
                    <div>
                        White noise, for me, holds a special significance. It’s the primal sound we encounter as infants
                        in the womb, our first auditory experience. In contrast, the outside world seems eerily silent
                        to babies. This notion of enveloping noise, perhaps, is a more natural state
                        for us.

                    <div>That’s beautiful. My research has led me to explore different sorts of noise. For instance,
                        there are noise algorithms for generating visuals. There’s visual noise in general, like static
                        on a television, and also noise in economics, psychological noise, and more.</div>
                    <div>When I read your piece on <a href="https://writings.laurel.world/the-cuteness-of-white-noise/"
                            target="_blank">‘The cuteness of white noise,’<sub>↗</sub></a> I was drawn to the discussion
                        about
                        the relationship between birth or being in the womb and white noise. What I find intriguing
                        about white noise is its sound perspective—it’s essentially all frequencies played at the same
                        level. As you said, it’s like you’re enveloped in this encompassing frequency. And then you go
                        to nothing. Maybe if we could expand a little bit more on any thoughts you have on that.</div>

            <div class="interview-speaker">

                <div class="interview-speaker-text-second">
                    <div>We could think of white noise as the sonic equivalent of the color gray. Although, it’s funny
                        because it’s called white noise. But it’s actually equal levels of these frequencies. Let’s
                        think about the color gray and RGB; it’s an equal R, G, and B. Sometimes it’s easier to start
                        sketching on a gray or brown page as opposed to a white page because it’s more in this middle
                        ground, where we feel like we can go darker or lighter if we have a lighter colored pencil. In
                        high school, I always used to sketch on brown paper.</div>
                    <div>It also made the colors look nicer. And I often feel that web designers like gray, or at least
                        presenting their work in gray, because so many websites are white by default, and it’s just nice
                        to have some dimensionality to differentiate. It’s fun to think about the background color of
                        websites.</div>
                    This topic reminds me of a website and a piece of writing I did about <a
                        href="https://laurelschwulst.com/e/the-evolving-designs-of-sulki-and-min/" target="_blank">Sulki
                        and Min.<sub>↗</sub></a> They are two Korean designers based in Seoul and have been active since
                    the early 2000s. I’m a big fan of them and their website. In my writing, I talked about why I liked
                    their website. If you notice, there’s a visual noise GIF in the background. And that noise GIF is
                    actually the GIF that was on the background of their site. When I wrote about their site in 2017, I
                    thought bringing back the background noise made sense. So, I went to archive.org and reinstalled it
                    on
                    my site.

                        Great. I’m excited to read it later. Another piece of your writing that I just read recently was
                        this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/28/arts/kiki-bouba-effect.html"
                            target="_blank">Kiki Bouba piece<sub>↗</sub></a> you did for <span class="italic-text">The
                            New York Times</span>, which was
                        so fun. For those not
                        familiar, the effect is a classic psycho-linguistics experiment that explores the relationship
                        between nonsense words and abstract shapes, revealing connections between the phonetic qualities
                        of words and the visual characteristics of shapes, such as the sharp, abrupt sounds of “Kiki”
                        contrasting with the soft, rounded sounds of “Bouba.”
                    </div>
                    <div>The Kiki Bouba effect made me think of semantic noise, which is described as the interference
                        in communication caused by differences in words and symbols in different attributes. </div>
                    <div>And what I found interesting about this Kiki Bouba effect is it almost feels like it cuts
                        through the noise related to semantics. These are like atomic structures of thought that
                        everyone can relate to. I was thinking about the difference between red and green. And how 86%
                        of people agree that red is Kiki. How do you feel about the Kiki Bouba effect and its
                        relationship to noise?</div>

                    <div>What you’re speaking to is the strength of communication—specific communication without words,
                        or just how communication can be precise but almost more sense-based through the five senses.
                    </div>
                    <div>Like you said, it’s crazy how accurate or maybe unanimous the red-green one was. I would assume
                        everyone thinks Kiki is red and Bouba is green. In that way, you’re talking about cutting
                        through the noise.</div>
                    <div>I would say language and speech are kind of our default as humans. So, we have to find other
                        ways of communicating to cut through the noise. Other examples might be sensory ways of
                        communicating—for example, music or other sensory ways to communicate. It’s like, “Yeah that,
                        that’s it.” But we can’t explain in words what “that” is. It’s almost as if it’s some mood. It’s
                        interesting, there’s almost a Kiki mood. </div>

                        purchase on Amazon. It could be more pragmatic. But it’s funny; I only used it for a few years,
                        and I don’t own it anymore. I don’t know what I did with it, but I don’t use a white noise

                        informational noise is at an all-time high. Things are coming at us so fast—and all the time.
                        It’s almost expected that we’re not only always available to incoming pings but also able to

                        be one of the most valuable “currencies” of our time because paying attention to something means
                        a lot in an ecosystem of many competing,
                        noisy things.

                                knowledge. What could yours be?”

                        </a> I collected some quotes that were then expressed as sparrow
                        memes. The first sparrow meme was by the editor-in-chief of Wired magazine, Lewis Rosetto, in
                        the early 90s. He basically says that meaning and context are the ultimate luxury in an age of
                        information overload. It’s so interesting that he said that in 1993. Because it’s like, “Wow,
                        they were feeling it then.” </div>

                    <div>Oh, wow, exciting. Yeah. I love that one. It’s also from the 90s. It’s from 1996. Two
                        researchers at Xerox PARC wrote it. Sometimes, I give this to my students because this piece is
                        almost the history of computing. They talk about how computers were so complex in the early days
                        that they had to be big, like a mainframe. And many people shared one computer. Then we got to
                        the age of personal computers, where every person had one computer. And now, we’re in an age of
                        what they call ubiquitous computing, which is about many computers sharing each of us. I would
                        also say, each of us having many computers. The Internet of things, sort of era. They talk
                        about, okay, if we’re going to go from mainframe to ubiquitous computing, calmness will continue
                        to be an important feeling we need to achieve in the design of computing and the design of the
                        Internet. </div>
                    <div>They say something interesting to me at the end about something they call the periphery. They
                        say, “We use ‘periphery’ to name what we are attuned to without attending to it explicitly.”
                        They explain how, when you’re driving, you’re always focused on the center of the road. But of
                        course, you’re paying attention to other stuff like if there’s an accident zooming by.</div>
                    <div>They say something counterintuitive, which is interesting. They say that they think a good
                        strategy to work towards would be like driving when you’re focused but still attuned to the
                        environment. There needs to be more things like this with the design of computers for the
                        Internet—where these are sort of like atmospheric signals. But you’re still focused on your main
                        thing. And they say that if you increase information overload a lot, we’ll have to deal with it.
                        And that stuff is just going to zoom by. And then, maybe because we’re experiencing so much, we
                        will be better at choosing what’s most important, which I find funny. But it’s kind of true in
                        some ways.</div>
                    <div>So I don’t know. Maybe I just went off the deep end a little bit. But I guess this is always
                        something I think about. I don’t know if it’s enacted in my designs.</div>
                    <div>I am designing this website for an architecture firm right now. One thing I’ve been thinking
                        about is that they have projects all over the world. And they’re very interested in light
                        websites and the five senses. I’ve been thinking about how it would be neat if there were a way
                        to feel the place of the site when you’re on a certain project. So you could know it was sunset
                        there or something like that.</div>
                    <div>Even if it’s just the background color shifting some, there needs to be more ways to
                        communicate that that’s on the periphery but still felt. </div>

                        question what’s accepted or the dominant narrative. So, on that topic, what do you think about
                        the future of design on the Internet and interactive design, maybe one year or ten years from

                    <div>Yeah, it’s a good question. Maybe I’ve talked about this before, but two things are coming up
                        for me. I think we will continue to see more and more less screen-based things. I’m also very
                        curious about the future of audio just because I find it a bit more of a humane medium. It’s
                        funny. You could have overlapping sounds, but there’s something about the directness and only
                        being able to listen to one stream at a time that feels useful for being a healthy human. I also
                        think about people walking around, looking at their phones, and crashing into each other. Or how
                        their eyesight is eventually going to start to go.</div>
                    <div>I’m just very interested in a future of more embodied technology that works for people and
                        helps them achieve their goals rather than distracting them further.</div>
                    <div>This is random and funny, but I was doing a workshop two weekends ago at the University of
                        Tennessee. While I was there, I talked with one of the other faculty members at the University
                        of Tennessee. She has two kids and said that one of her kids is next level and whenever he goes
                        on the Internet or uses Minecraft, he says that he only uses it in peaceful mode. He won’t do
                        anything destructive in Minecraft, and if he sees a violent video, he’ll be like, “No, I’m in
                        peaceful mode.” I feel like the Internet needs some peaceful mode, not just for kids but for
                        humanity in general.</div>

                        that I would like to see. Of course, if this is actually going to happen, it needs to come from
                        the ground level. But I also think there needs to be some people in positions of power making

                        problems would be solved if we had upload and download limits, just in general, on the Internet.
                        I moved last week, and I didn’t have Internet at my house for a few days, and the service was
                        also bad; I only got 2 bars. So when I tried to load Instagram, no videos played. And I was
                        thinking, “Oh, my God! Thank God! Like I didn’t wanna do that, anyway.” Of course, there’s value
                        to Instagram sometimes, and I enjoy being connected to lots of smart and interesting people. But
                        I feel like some limitation that’s imposed for a collective good would be possibly very

                    <div>Yeah, exactly. It has an E Ink display so it looks like a Kindle screen. The idea is that you
                        get one that works in concert with your smartphone. And so if you want to go out on a walk but
                        don’t want all of the functions of your smartphone, you take your Light phone out. Then, you can
                        call and look up maps, text, and essential things. It’s like a way to be more present in the

                        We were thinking, “It’d be awesome if everyone just had the Light Phone because then we wouldn’t
                        have to explain, <span class="italic-text">‘Sorry, I’m on my Light Phone; I can’t receive images
                            right now.’</span>” It would be more
                        collective. I do know there was <a

                            target="_blank">an experiment<sub>↗</sub></a> where one school acquired Light Phones for all
                        the
                        students, measured the results, and said that it was really good for people’s attention levels
                        over
                        time.
                    </div>
                    <div>I feel that maybe at the school level, more experiments like this should take place. Because
                        these populations are interlinked but still individual, they’re collective but not the size of a
                        nation. Smaller places where you can do experiments like this.</div>
                    <div>What do you think of all those ideas?</div>

                    <div>Yeah. I agree with you on all of that. And I think the media needs to bring out the coolness of
                        the Light Phone if we’re going to make that happen widespread. I have some younger family
                        members, and the influence of being “cool” is very seductive. This influence of “coolness” can
                        put you into some traps with social media and things like that.</div>
                    <div>What are your thoughts on AI if a hopeful future looks like a step towards the Light Phone?
                        Does AI get in the way of that? And how does that look in a world where AI is becoming
                        increasingly a part of our lives?</div>

                    <div>Everyone’s asking about AI, and I think it’s fascinating and insane at the same time. It can be
                        a huge help for a lot of talented people to make their jobs easier. But it’s just good when we
                        work with AI to understand its limitations and what it’s good at and not good at.</div>
                    <div>There’s an article I’ve been enjoying by Elan Ullendorff. He writes this Substack called Deep
                        Sea Diving, and he wrote a piece called <a
                            href="https://escapethealgorithm.substack.com/p/the-new-turing-test" target="_blank">“The
                            New Turing Test.”<sub>↗</sub></a> This talks about AI in the context of creativity.
                        Actually, this circles back to that Lewis Rosetto quote, which says, “In an age of information
                        overload, the ultimate luxury is meaning and context.” Elan says, “I have a nontraditional set
                        of standards through which I encourage my students to evaluate their work (curiosity,
                        criticality, communication, conscientiousness).”</div>
                    <div>It has three simple criteria. </div>
                    <div>
                        <div>Number one. It feels like it came <span class="italic-text">from</span> someone. </div>
                        <div>Number two. It feels like it was meant <span class="italic-text">for</span> someone.</div>
                        <div>
                            Number three. It feels like it belongs in a <span class="italic-text">particular
                                context</span>.
                            It’s aware of the place, time, culture, and artistic medium in which it will be consumed.
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div>AI to me in general is similar to information overload. I agree with Elan when he says “But for
                        everything else, asking how much AI is in something may be less important than a simpler
                        question: how much humanity is in it?” I don’t know how to answer this regarding a feature of
                        the Internet. I find AI quite helpful in certain contexts. But I think the humanity thing is key
                        and something I’m interested in.</div>
                    <div>One other thread I’ve been thinking about is, in an age when we’re getting good at talking to
                        computers, basically, in an age when we’re getting good at asking Chat GPT questions, I think it
                        becomes increasingly important for us to learn how to talk to ourselves, and speak to other
                        humans. And I find that conversation being the medium quite interesting. Gordon Brander is
                        working on this <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/subconscious-alpha"
                            target="_blank">enchanted notes app<sub>↗</sub></a>, which is a notes app for yourself. But
                        what it does is it
                        uses AI in the notes app to bring up unexpected connections between things that you’ve written
                        down in the past. I find that a very cool and valuable use of AI to help you understand links in
                        your thinking. To help you become a better human.</div>

                    <div>I appreciate it. AI has huge potential for good and huge potential for bad; that’s obvious.

                    <div>My first thought has to do with humanity. One thing I like about working in the digital is that
                        it makes me more aware of how links exist in the physical, especially in terms of networks of
                        people.</div>
                    <div>Something nice about starting to research this architecture website I’m currently working on is
                        that I’ve been going through all the texts of their books and their practice. As I look through
                        these books, I’m like, “Wow, the website is basically here; in the books, I just have to
                        translate it.” I find that thinking about one’s practice in terms of links of people or
                        structures that are just emergent is valuable, and we don’t need to outsource everything to be
                        digital all the time because links are already inherently human. I hope that’s not too abstract
                        of a piece of advice.</div>
                    <div>I also think maybe a good piece of advice that calms me a lot is to work with what’s here—that
                        is, what’s already here. I don’t actually need to invent anything new. It might be just about
                        rearranging some stuff or translating some stuff.</div>
                    <div>In art school, there’s always this pressure to invent, invent, invent. But we can rethink what
                        invention means, and sometimes, it can be about rearrangement or arrangement or translation—a
                        translation to a new age or something like that.</div>

                        I’m going to be doing a project with everyone called “local website.”</div>
                    <div>The plan is for everyone to choose a location on campus and make a website accessible only in
                        that location. So, it’s going to start with some site-specificity assignments. It will be about
                        noticing the site and atmospheric attunement. I’m inviting this artist and my friend named
                        Austin Wade Smith into my class, and they’re giving a lecture that I’m excited about called
                        <span class="italic-text">Aeromancy in Everyday Life</span>. Aeromancy is a fancy word that
                        means atmospheric conditions. And so
                        they’ll talk about how their practice is interested in understanding the atmosphere in many
                        different ways.
                    </div>
                    <div>It’s going to end with a little workshop on how to become more attuned to your site, and then I
                        think we might fly kites after that. </div>
