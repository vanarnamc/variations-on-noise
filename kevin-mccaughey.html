                    Kevin McCaughey is a designer and co-founder of Boot Boyz Biz, a research and production cooperative
                    based in New York.

                    Kevin’s love for music is apparent in the collection of bootleg clothing Boot Boyz Biz produces. The
                    most intriguing thing about his practice to me is the research on each specific clothing release,
                    and how the piece is meant to act as a container for research. His in-depth approach to clothing and
                    graphic design has influenced my practice and how I think about design. The song he contributed to
                    the mix was <span class="italic-text">Ghosts of My Life</span> by Rufige Kru aka Goldie, which he
                    discusses further in
                    the interview.

                Much of your work uses various forms of noise to communicate an idea or even love for an object. I’m
                thinking of both physical noise with distortion of images and noise in musicians such as Björk, Grace
                Jones, Yellow Magic Orchestra, and Laurie Anderson. How do you define noise, and what role does noise
                serve in the context of graphic design and in your practice? </div>

                <div>“Thinking is a putting-aside, rather than a putting-in discipline, e.g., putting aside the tall
                    grasses in order to isolate the trail into informative viewability. Thinking is FM-frequency
                    modulation-for it results in tuning-out of irrelevancies as a result of definitive resolution of the
                    exclusively tuned-in or accepted feed-back messages’ pattern differentiability.” <div>—Buckminster

                <div>The stochastic screen (used in print processing and in music formulated by Xenakis) is the modern
                    update to the classic halftone screen. Whereas the halftone screen is a fixed crystalline structure,
                    the stochastic (also called FM Screen) is amorphous and undetermined up close. Its noise pattern
                    brings more resolution but also more chaos to the image. This development resembles the

                <div>Noise is still the rhythm of the present — we’re warped by its exploding presence brought by
                    globalization and technology. The complex task is to read through (not against) noise and collect
                    the things that empower us, not exhaust and dehumanize us. What empowers us is not what ‘feels good’
                    but what challenges our current vision of what’s possible and illuminates an alternative — it starts
                    with a new way of reading noise. We need noise (information) control to function.</div>
                <div>Alexander Kluge speaks of the task of developing the ‘dragonfly eye’. Holding many points of view
                    simultaneously. Nodes that interconnect unevenly. You have to continually speak ‘through’ noise to
                    connect with the fragmented nonlinear, multi-perspective world. Villem Flusser talks about how our
                    time is experienced as a pile of sand, not unlike a field of noise. In this sandpile every grain of
                    sand is a historical event — evidence we depend on for decision making. We construct how we see the
                    world based on what grains make up the pile. Its form reflects its parts. Is this sandcastle
                    surrounded by a moat of power or are others outside of power allowed to dismantle its failings and
                    determine its shape?</div>
                <div>Noise can lead the pathway to inquiry — its obscuring power ends the automatism of perception,
                    slowing it down and complicating meanings, and forces the imagination to fill in the blanks,
                    disrupting dominant patterns of thought.</div>
                <div>I’m thinking of the image of noise and the image of how stars appear to us in the night sky. It’s
                    incomprehensible as a fragmented whole, but once you start making connections between bright points
                    (what’s meaningful, useful) a legible picture emerges from noise.</div>
                <div>The common thread between the artists you mention is that they resist specialization and refuse to
                    be pinned down by disciplinary strictures (forced to one constellation) and embrace a kind of
                    shape-shifting practice, jumping from constellation to constellation, putting the large field of
                    noise into an interconnected view. This constellation-building practice gets us closer to
                    understanding noise not as meaningless fragments but as pieces of a complex ‘whole’ that are
                    interdependent — even though in reality it remains in ‘pieces’. </div>

                    One of my favorite tees from you is the Rhythm Prince tee, which is a tee that pays homage to the
                    drum machine the synth-punk Suicide used. I have a deep love for this tee (outside of my love for
                    Suicide) because it acted as an educational tool, and created relationships between technology and
                    art. How do you see the relationship between technology and art in your practice? Do you have any
                    speculations about what that looks like in the next decade, and will that impact the thinking behind
                    your output?

                <div>The aim is to put this relationship between technology and creativity into clear view. Highlighting
                    the means of production, the ’how’ of making, not just the ’who’ and ’what’ on the surface. Bringing
                    to light that creatives are never working alone. We need tools to mediate and our messages are
                    largely determined by their potential. Its liberatory potential depends on how it’s used and for
                    whom it benefits.

                </div>
                <div>Don’t forget, clothing and screen printing are technologies. All mediums are, as extensions of
                    human abilities. Their full potential has yet to be witnessed. They communicate through echos and
                    appear on a different layer/order of reality— an imaginative one. The graphic tee cannot work
                    socially without being worn (though the market and the internet complicate this) and our bodies can
                    only produce limited visual communication—a symbiotic agreement is made. </div>
                <div>In the work we are dependent on so many processes and technologies—from Adobe to our Vastex
                    Printing Press, the blank t-shirt distributor, and USPS logistics (and many more in between). An
                    understanding of the whole system that you participate in gives you a heightened economic and
                    political perspective. You realize that you are “in business” with a lot of people you wish you were
                    not. This consciousness allows you to make more responsible decisions.</div>

                    Information continues to explode onto the internet if you know where to look. But things are also
                    disappearing. Google obviously
                    sucks now so people will hopefully start to create new alternative knowledge resources.

                    Screen printing is a big business and slowly evolving technology but the recent developments appear
                    to be easing the complexity. New tech that eliminates most chemicals involved in screen-burning
                    could potentially make it easier to print from home, allowing for new experimentation.
                    Print-on-demand is big and a huge negative for the world, and people increasingly sense the poor
                    quality-which could spark a demand for hand-prints.

                <div>Tees in the wild condition us. They link us and repel us. Ack-nowledging this is a redemption of
                    the ugly term ’streetwear’. It’s training through looking. Architecture and advertising have a
                    similar semiconscious effect on us. The making of our visual landscape is a making of ourselves;
                    that means we can realize new forms of connectivity. However, we also make our own passive
                    alienation. To realize a less separated relationship to the world and each other doesn’t mean just
                    putting out positive vibes but making objects politically.</div>
                <div>In this commodity culture, we have to play with the contradictions for creative advantage, but we
                    try to eliminate as many as we can without sabotaging the economy of the project. The main
                    contradiction being the commodity tethered to education and having to sell something for our project
                    to survive while also providing social value. We produce politically by organizing as a co-operative
                    and we limit what we produce to our direct abilities— eliminating waste by meeting direct demand and
                    printing DIY to eliminate alienated production. This way we never have to ‘sell’. </div>
                <div>Images that instrumentalize identity lead to an atomized, tribalized engagement with the world that
                    continues the logic of capitalism and private property. Tees certainly can participate in the petty
                    “narcissism of small differences.” But this attitude has to be recognized as the immature stage of
                    engagement with social objects. If we approach images as tools for connecting with others, they can
                    open up a new kind of collectivity. The image landscape has exploded via technology, and graphic
                    tees are a mediator for temporarily pinning down forms and ideas to be shared and discussed. Its
                    virtues derive from their ability to create a unique kind of noise that oscillates between the
                    personal and collective, subjective and objective, a blurring that speaks to modernity.</div>
                <div>The tee is powerful in space, as a ‘proxemic’ actor (Edward T. Hall). One with potential is one
                    that activates all of the social spaces (personal, social, and public) where its legibility changes
                    and unrolls as one draws closer or farther. The point is to create contact that wouldn’t happen
                    otherwise. The tee can be a kind of ‘amulet’ that can improve our spirit and hold our attention
                    within the whirlwind — batteries storing energy for unexpected use — a counter-spectacle, that
                    shocks us to wake us up from complacency.</div>

                    When making a new item, it seems like there is a thorough amount of research and preparation that
                    happens before the output is clear, and a lot of the research does not make it into the final
                    output. (Not sure this would even be possible considering how much research goes into each product).
                    Can you speak a little more about what parts of the research are turned into the final output, and

                    The research is often sparked by a simple urge to share something that’s impacted our lives recently
                    or in the past, but we give ourselves space to complicate this singular subject through an
                    undetermined digging and stitching process (organization!). On the journey to collect materials and
                    organize a layout, unexpected material takes us on productive detours where we embrace expanded and
                    serendipitous connections that unlock something new when illuminated in conjunction with our initial
                    subject. The research is really an uncovering of a wider labyrinth of connections that isn’t visible
                    until the pathways are marked, compounding and revealing a new web of information.

                <div>A tee works when its message penetrates a viewer’s image of the world. The arrangement has to tell
                    a coherent story, but it requires new pictorial reading that’s nonlinear and more ambiguous. New
                    intentional relationships between images need to be interpreted. Our moment of “noise” (as discussed
                    earlier in the text) has conditioned us to experience time polychronically the ability to attend
                    multiple events simultaniously. The multiple significance of signs on
                    top of signs is becoming a comfortable pastime. For most it still requires a ‘double take’ taking a
                    viewer out of automatic perception and
                    activating thought.</div>
                <div>This is the language of film and also of lowly advertising, the front page of newspapers,
                    19th-century “catchpennies,” ancient illuminated manuscripts, and emblem books from the renaissance
                    (all ancestors of the poster and t-shirt). They share a common literary method: “headline, image,
                    caption.” By tapping into this simple tripartite visual rhythm (bass, strings, vocal in music) one
                    can generate infinite complexity. It’s a starting scheme to be further developed and later turned on
                    its head.</div>

                <div>Above all the arrangement has to activate the intellectual and emotional, the rational and
                    irrational. What graphics make it onto an object corresponds to its potential for creating
                    situations as a worn sign that activates any of these responses. The content and medium have to be
                    in sync, which means legibility across multiple distances in social settings. If the material is too
                    banal, novel or illegible it has less of a chance for being noticed. This is all obvious. An
                    effective way to generate notice is to meet people where they’re at by showing something at once
                    familiar and unfamiliar, where the new and unknown springs from the already known. Referencing what
                    people already expect from t-shirts (a 70-year history to draw from) can act as a Trojan horse for
                    introducing new forms and ideas. When something’s ’slightly off’ people take notice. A simple “logo
                    flip” is the simplest version of this. Shock is the quickest way to affect someone’s nervous system
                    but it is not sustainable (unless you’re the New York Post) and people are most generous and open to
                    a reading when they’re at ease and understand at least part of a visual puzzle right away. This is
                    also a strategy for building knowledge through constructive links. Tees can then become gateways
                    into the details we have on the website and become a mnemonic device or a kind of emblem of
                    compressed thought — a mental map, a sigil, a tool for reflection and memory. A diagram of complex
                    data that accelerates understanding and reveals routes for deeper exploration. The shirt explodes
                    inwards spiritually and outwards socially.</div>

                <div>This is a guiding spirit. Mark Fisher talked about this one too. It is so emblematic of this drive
                    we share—to renew the best of the past (here it’s Goldie updating Japan’s “Ghosts” from 1981),
                    bringing it into constellation with the present (Goldie’s Jungle generation of the early 90s). It’s
                    a blueprint for using the past as raw material for making something completely new without
                    diminishing the truth content of the past. A progressive recycling, not impotent melancholic
                    nostalgia. Here the past and present are on equal footing and in symbiotic relation. To produce
                    something like this requires a responsible translation. This doesn’t mean any kind of loyalty or
                    literal translation of the original, but it requires an ability to understand two worlds, multiple
                    perspectives and languages simultaneously and see how and where they fit together to make unforeseen
                    sparks. This track is history transformed–made compact and intelligible to a new generation raised

                    forums, late 2000s social media, blogs and p2p sites with chat rooms. In those spaces you understand
                    the real potentials of file-sharing combined with discussion (everyone’s library is a unique
                    constellation), which becomes a mode of simultaneous building and sharing—a super productive mode
                    for learning that rivals any “official education.” There you learn to freely express and play with
                    language (before followers existed). What’s missing are any kind of standards for good writing.

                    toxic) people working to discover for themselves what’s good under their own direct control. But
                    these spaces are transient, so the aim since then has been to seek out or develop similar and
                    updated frameworks for continuing to add to this great discussion of what’s valuable (information
                    war). Aesthetics are involved in convincing people why something matters (rhetoric, propaganda).
                    Bridging the URL with the IRL was a next step which led me to self-publishing and design.

                <div>As my interests evolved beyond music (into design, art, philosophy etc) this method for

                    media from other disciplines located in a different landscape well protected or unavailable online.
                    Meaning it’s unavailable to most others too. At a certain point of digging you hit proverbial
                    paywalls or an institutional gatekeeper that denies access to quality material that would help
                    improve a growing conception of the world for many. Access denied (due to lack of economic or social
                    capital) requires alternative methods to reach an objective. This involves smuggling — rescuing and
                    liberating what’s been locked up or hidden is the primary action. Teenage experiences of ripping
                    unheard records and uploading them to Soulseek is close to the current method of organizing found
                    material onto ‘objects-to-think-with.’ The movement of mp3s circulating on networks is analogous to

                    being read? Condensed forms don’t have to be of lesser quality or impact. Any medium and tool has
                    the ability to drop its therapeutic or entertainment function and become one in the service of
                    education and socialization. The goal isn’t to replace the academic text, but to lead a person into
                    it that would never encounter it otherwise, and then carry on its ideas as an educational beacon.
                    Tees work as potent tools because they’re in touch with the emotions of modern life—the desire to
                    share signs with hopes of building new associations and knowledge with others through values in
                    common. Illuminating signs unroll into a new use value, newly organized images lead to newly
                    organized people (who organizes the images and for what purpose is most important). The meaningful,
                    surprising interactions mediated by these tools help knowledge stick and generate further inquiry.
                    As long as the ‘official education’ is reserved for a select few, these unofficial objects like Tees
                    will provide a similar temporary scaffolding that ignites a process of interiorizing and socializing
                    knowledge. </div>
