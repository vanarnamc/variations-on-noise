                        What is it? The question seems simple — yet it’s tough to define. Is noise sound? For some, the
                        answer’s obvious — yes, it is. But what about visual noise on an old television screen? Or,
                        noise in economics? In the book <span class="italic-text">Noise: A Flaw in Human
                            Judgment</span>, Daniel Kahneman describes noise
                        as irrelevant or misleading data and information that can cause misinterpretation of economic
                        indicators, leading to incorrect decisions by investors, analysts, and policymakers. Other noise
                        examples might include computer programming algorithms, psychological noise, and more.

                        and how it shapes science, audio, culture, and other aspects of our lives. It offers a range of

                        The subject of noise has become a starting point for me to conduct seven interviews with
                        designers, artists, musicians, and a <a href="./lobsang-yonten.html">Tibetan monk</a>. Each
                        interview offers unique insight into
                        personal experiences and ways to approach the world through noise. These interviews taught me
                        considerably about noise and helped me better
                        understand humanity.

                        But what are my thoughts on this looming subject? Is this a game of semantics? Why am I
                        attracted to noise? The answer lies in multitudes of forms.

                        From a sonic perspective, noise creates dissonance and fullness in sound, a seeming paradox.
                        Sonically, ‘white noise’ refers to every frequency the human ear can hear played at the same
                        amplitude. Then where does the dissonance come from? My thinking lies in the idea that it’s
                        fundamental to the human condition. From our time in the womb, the human body is surrounded by
                        noise, and so the world appears to be silent.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        An example is the “shhh” sound, akin to white noise, which soothes babies by mimicking the
                        comforting, constant sounds of the womb familiar from their prenatal environment. Scientists
                        support its use as part of calming techniques, emphasizing its effectiveness in mirroring the
                        continuous background noise experienced before birth. Culture, music, and language create
                        patterns in our minds; disruptions to those patterns are called noise simply because we are not
                        used to it. But strangely, we need it. The world of sound can be exceptionally sterile without
                        noise, and noise can act as both a catalyst for dissonance and change in music. I am interested
                        in the experimental nature of noise and the surrounding communities. Over the last two years,
                        I’ve been organizing noise shows and bringing people together to experiment with sound and
                        noise. The events, titled Rave by Design, allowed me to try different experimental approaches
                        to sounds and create posters for the show and live visuals for the performances. </div>

                        Another way I introduce noise in my musical practice is by ambiance. Ambient noise and Drone
                        music might also seem like a paradox: How can ambiance be noise? Consider informational noise.
                        From click-bait journalism to the shortening attention span of the public, we live in a world of
                        information overflow. When an audience member hears a sound whose evolution is to change over an
                        hour rather than a second, many uncomfortable feelings might arrive. Slowness can bring out the
                        noise of the mind and, perhaps with recognition we can improve it. With the help of friends, I
                        organized a live event at the RISD Museum titled Ambience as Noise, where artists came
                        together and performed drone music for two hours—the event created an interruption into a
                        hyper-stimulated media landscape through slowness.

                    <div>
                        I approach design as a musician, where technology becomes an instrument for generating ideas. My
                        interest in typography has led me to create custom software that interacts with language
                        similarly to how I might interact with a synthesizer. Programming languages and writing custom
                        software allow me to expand on this practice because I can create custom tools to tell a
                        particular story and create a larger narrative. An example is a video piece I made with the same
                        title of this book, Variations on Noise.06 The video is an essay exploring the notion of noise
                        and its relationship to the human body. I wrote custom software for this project, which tracks
                        the motion of the human body, outputs the data to live synthesizers, and generates new
                        typographic forms. Using typography and graphic form the same way a musician would use their
                        instrument, I was able to comment on more extensive texts and connect philosophical ideas of
                        noise, such as Micah Silver’s <span class="italic-text">Figures of Air</span>, Damon Kruoski’s
                        <span class="italic-text">Ways of Hearing</span>, and Jacques

                        As a visual designer, I use noise to create pseudo-randomness while maintaining consistency in
                        design work. Thanks to Ken Perlin, who made the Perlin Noise algorithm, I can generate
                        procedural textures and use them to create natural-seeming patterns in visual environments. I
                        apply Perlin noise most in my design practice by creating fluctuation in repetitive typographic
                        design work. While programming, I often use repetitive patterns; and noise helps to create
                        variations in some of those patterns. Visual designers can use noise to create anything from
                        mountains to clouds to the ocean. Without noise, the work of a generative artist would be
                        challenging and tedious.

                    <div>
                        In the current technological era of advanced artificial intelligence and attachment to social
                        media (and to the screen), noise is the information we are surrounded by. Noise is what is
                        fighting for our attention. In my practice, I comment on these ideas through design projects
                        like <a href="https://www.inourti.me/" target="_blank">inourti.me</a>. <a href="https://www.inourti.me/" target="_blank">​inourti.me</a>​ uses facial recognition technology to monitor the user’s eye
                        movements using their computer’s camera. Each time the user blinks, the system generates a new
                        daily headline from
                        The New York Times and initiates a timer to measure the duration the user spends reading this
                        headline. The time taken to read the headline influences the next interaction: the longer the
                        reading time, the more intense and ‘noisy’ the sound generated upon the user’s subsequent blink.
                        The piece acts as a commentary on how we consume media, click-bait journalism, and surveillance.
