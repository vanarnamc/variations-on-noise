            Suzanne Ciani is a five-time Grammy award-nominated composer,
            electronic music pioneer, and neo-classical recording artist who has
            released over twenty solo albums including
            <span class="italic-text">Seven Waves</span>, and
            <span class="italic-text">The Velocity of Love</span>, along with a
            landmark quad LP <span class="italic-text">LIVE Quadraphonic</span>,
            which restarted her Buchla modular performances. Her work has been
            featured in films, games, and countless commercials as well.
          </div>
          <div>
            She was inducted into the first class of Keyboard Magazine’s Hall of
            Fame alongside other synth luminaries, including Bob Moog, Don
            Buchla, and Dave Smith and received the Moog Innovation Award. Most
            recently, she is the recipient of the Independent Icon Award from
            A2IM.
          </div>
          <div>
            Suzanne has provided the voice and sounds for Bally’s groundbreaking
            “Xenon” pinball machine, created Coca-Cola’s pop-and-pour sound,
            designed logos for Fortune 500 companies, and carved out a niche as
            one of the most creatively successful female composers in the world.
            <span class="italic-text">A Life in Waves</span>, a documentary
            about Ciani’s life and work, debuted at SXSW in 2017 and is
            available to watch on all digital platforms.
          </div>
          <div>
            Ciani is a graduate of Wellesley College and holds a Masters in
            Music Composition from the University of California, Berkeley.
          </div>
          <div>
            On a personal note — I was first introduced to Suzanne’s work at a
            record store in Los Angeles where they were celebrating the
            re-release of her
            <span class="italic-text">Buchla Concerts 1975</span>
            album. The album is a live performance on the Buchla synthesizer,
            and I was fascinated by the sounds she was able to produce. Since
            then, Suzanne has been a huge influence on my work and the way I
            think about noise and sound. It was an honor to speak with her about
            noise, and the way she thinks about life.

          Because of my relationship with the Buchla synthesizer, noise is my
          access to the white noise generator and the creation of waveforms.
          From what we know about white noise, it includes every frequency. I
          use that as a starting point for my concerts. Whatever I’m going to do
          is born out of noise, and I think that’s an appropriate connection
          because everything is in there. We often think of noise as dissonance,
          attack, or unwanted sound or chatter. But for me, noise is simply a
          palette or a starting point.

            It’s interesting to consider white noise as a starting point.
            Certain psychologists think that the “sh” sound used by parents to
            calm babies mimics the constant, whooshing white noise heard in the
            womb, which is attributed to the mother’s blood flow and bodily
            functions. This sound is thought to soothe infants by replicating
            the comforting and familiar auditory environment of the womb, acting
            as a form of white noise that can have a calming effect. The
            relationship between white noise and birth is fascinating to me.

            I embraced his vision of a new musical instrument. It was the 200
            series Buchla synthesizer then. This instrument was a complete
            180-degree turn from my classical training. What he taught me was
            freedom. He had an attitude until the end of working with his
            instrument as a collaborative artistic expression. As an artist, I’m
            working within the frame of what he’s given me as a tool. And that
            tool is a very open architecture. There’s nothing defined. It gives
            you so many choices to create and express yourself. You choose the
            modules, you choose the patch, and you select the raw materials that
            you’re going to use. But all of this choosing is an expression of
            freedom in designing what it is that you’re going to do.
          </div>
          <div>
            Don had a certain attitude towards the world. For instance, I would
            ask him, “Don, this module will not tune properly; it’s driving me
            crazy because I can’t calibrate it into my tuning system.” And he’d
            look at me and say, “We’ll do something else. Don’t try to force
            your will on something that doesn’t want to do what you want to do.”

            Speaking of the Buchla synthesizer, an analog instrument, how do you
            feel about the difference between analog and digital noise?
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="interview-speaker">

          <div>
            Theoretically, digital can do anything analog does because it’s just
            a matter of computational power and direction. We all say that you
            can replicate anything if you have enough data, and digital is data.
            But in general, I don’t think that data alone is a measure of
            musical functionality, so it’s not interesting to me that you might
            be able to do it.
          </div>
          <div>
            It’s like the difference between analog and digital recording
            technology. During the transition from analog tape to digital
            recording, I was doing an album and had two multi-track machines,
            one analog and one digital. There was a 32-track Mitsubishi digital
            machine02 and a 24-track analog tape recorder. As an experiment, I
            would record each sound on both machines and then make a subjective,
            empirical decision based on just my ears. In general, the
            high-frequency sounds sounded better on the analog machine.

            I’m not trying to say that one is better than the other; it’s just a
            different universe. The analog is softer because it’s a little bit
            blurrier; it doesn’t have the edges that the digital one has. The
            digital machines have these edges because they do everything in
            increments, and even if those become infinitesimally small, they’re
            still increments and samples. So, I prefer analog.

            Many people gravitate towards analog machines and synthesizers
            because of their ‘imperfect’ qualities. It’s nearly impossible to
            replicate the same sound or patch again. What does perfection mean
            to you, both as an artist and as a person?
          </div>

        <div class="interview-speaker-text-second">
          <div>
            There are different levels of perfection. I tend to be a
            perfectionist in my studio album work because you’re in a situation
            you can control to the nth degree. If you get carried away with that
            control, though, you focus on minutia and aren’t focused as much on
            the big picture. The issue with perfectionism is that it replaces an
            appreciation for the whole, the communication of the whole, with a
            microcosmic focus that, in the end, might not be that significant
            for communication. We go down those perfectionistic tunnels as
            almost a distraction from serving the communication.

            What I love about live performances on the Buchla is that they are
            always different. That’s what I mean when I say it’s alive. It’s a
            life form of its own. That’s why we like it—it’s constantly changing
            and not frozen. It’s not a digital sample, which might be
            perfect—for example, a perfect sample of a perfect cello note. But
            those samples are dead. To be alive, it has to be in motion.

            I see life as a continuum. An individual has a specific span, and I
            will die, predictably, within the next twenty years at most. Life
            continues but is not housed in my existence. Right now, I’m very

            like that album because it elicits whatever happens when we feel
            love. After all, love is connection. We often consider it a
            person-to-person connection, but it could be as expansive as the
            universe.

            I remember hearing the album for the first time, and I know what you
            mean. It was a safe space. When creating work today, do you still
            feel like you are trying to create that safe space, or was that
            album specific? How do you think about this while you are making new
            work?

            Until I returned to the Buchla synthesizer seven or eight years ago,
            my career was rooted in classical music. Even though my first album,
            <span class="italic-text">Seven Waves</span> (1982), was all
            electronic, it was based on melody. And it was based on romance—not
            in the sense of a relationship, romance, but in romantic music.
            Romantic music was rooted in the idea that feeling was the focus.
            The idea was to elicit human emotion.

            What I’m doing now is more abstract. I’m in a chapter of my creative
            life which could be related to the visual artist who starts out
            doing representative work and then goes abstract. I’m in my abstract
            period. But my abstract period still references my classical roots.
            It’s just a new language. I create spaces, whether it’s an emotional
            space or an actual immersive sonic space, which I’m doing now
            because I’m focused on quadraphonic, spatial movement, and the
            three-dimensionality of the experience of listening. Creating these
            spaces is fundamental and essential to me.

            It’s a dangerous precipice because there are different levels of
            romanticism. For instance, there are cheap romance novels, romantic
            bodices, etc. There can be less inspiring levels of what we call
            romanticism. But for me, romanticism is the glue of the universe.
            It’s the idea that you can see a connection in nature, that your
            surroundings speak to you and include you, that you’re a part of it,
            and that you’re connected to all you know.

            That’s beautiful. Thank you. Because of your approach to technology,
            you opened new pathways for future artists, musicians, and designers
            and gave them new ways to think. You thought about the future of
            music in a radically different way, and this shaped your career and
            the careers of others. What do you think about the future of
            technology in art, music, and design?

            It’s funny because many things I thought would happen in the future
            haven’t happened until now. So, for me, this is almost a renaissance
            or a rebirth. What we’re doing is we are going backward. It’s so
            beautiful because there was a moment in history when we were about
            to go to a particular place, but we didn’t get there. We saw the
            future. But the future didn’t happen. Forty years later, it’s
            happening. It wasn’t a continuum. It wasn’t like we got on a
            trajectory, and we worked our way up to this point. No. It got lost.
            Then we came back and reinvestigated. So, it’s not a continuum; it
            is the finishing of something that was started and will continue.

            But that break happened because of technology. It happened because
            we got distracted by the pure technology of it, making it faster,
            better, and cheaper; it was all about the tools. It was not about
            realizing the real potential of the tools. We were just so focused
            on our appetites. We went from LPs to CDs to DVDs, and eventually,
            we became engulfed in the commercialization of technology, which
            became exhausting. The kids got tired and just had to say, “No, wait
            a minute, stop!” The rapid push towards technological innovation is
            why we now see a transition back to LPs and modular synthesizers.
            People are now interested in the interface. They are interested in
            how you connect to it. You can create those interfaces in many ways.
            For some reason, this didn’t happen until we went backward. Kids
            today want to turn a knob; they don’t want to look at a menu. You
            don’t want to choose from a list of 4,000 string sounds. It becomes
            exhausting. What I’m interested in working with now is the immediate
            satisfaction of interacting with the machine; there’s a deep joy in
            that.

          What I love about vinyl records, in particular, is that they force you
          to slow down and genuinely appreciate the album from front to back.
          There is no shuffle or skip. Plus, the physicality of holding the
          artwork adds another dimension to attaching yourself to the work. Do

            We are fascinated by the possibility of something being created
            without a human being generating it. You can go pretty far with
            that. But to have the prompts or the raw materials to foster that
            creation, you’re taking it from preexisting sources of creation.
            You’re just doing a new mix.

            But there have always been exceptional creators. To appreciate any
            artistic expression, you must be able to see or hear it and take it
            in; this can be lost on us if we don’t have the receptors to
            understand it. It’s so subjective. I can play Beethoven’s Fifth
            Symphony, and you could pass it by as if it were a news program if
            you aren’t paying attention if you can’t receive it. So there’s the
            generation and the receiver. All of that is non-literal. If I play a
            concert and there are 1,000 people in the room, there are a thousand
            different concerts. I do think that the ability to communicate on a
            rarified or exceptional level is a very complex dynamic.

            However, the problem with artificially generated art is that it has
            no soul. And I know that sounds like a total dismissal, and I’m not
            trying to say that it doesn’t have a wonderful place in our lives.
            But I think that you still need the human. I’m still a romantic
            about that one.

          There’s all the standard stuff, “follow your vision,” “don’t give up.”
          Oh, gosh! It all sounds so trite. But what I’ve always functioned from
          is realizing that the seed of your expression is within yourself. So
          you must be able to access communication within yourself, and if you
          can communicate with yourself, you access a universal connection.
          Because at our deepest, uncompromised, most open, vulnerable levels
          with ourselves, we tap into the infinite. Do what speaks to you. Don’t
          reference it outside for judgment. It isn’t very meaningful if
          somebody else likes it. You should ask yourself if you have satisfied
          your goal. Is that what you wanted to say without excuse? Do
          non-apologetic work. Your self-satisfaction is the ultimate judgment.
