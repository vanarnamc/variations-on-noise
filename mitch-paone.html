                    <div>Mitch Paone is the creative director of New York and Chamonix-based creative agency DIA Studio.
                        DIA Specializes in corporate and cultural visual identity systems, graphic design, and
                        typography. DIA’s signature use of motion and generative tools has led to significant
                        collaborations with clients such as Squarespace, Balenciaga, Pinterest, Nike, Saint Laurent,
                        Apple, and many more. Additionally, Mitch lectures and leads workshops at conferences and
                        universities worldwide. Most notably, Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK), Ecole cantonale
                        d’art de Lausanne (ECAL), Pratt Institute and the School for Visual Arts in New York. </div>
                    <div>
                        Mitch recently held positions at Haute école d’art et de design, Genève (HEAD – Genève) and The
                        Royal Academy of Art, The Hague (KABK). In his courses, he implemented DIA’s creative process
                        into the academic curriculum, specifically focusing on motion and generative tools in a graphic
                        design context. Mitch and DIA studio partner Meg Donohoe are AGI (Alliance Graphique
                        Internationale) members. Mitch is also a performing jazz pianist, composer, and type designer
                        beyond DIA and academic endeavors.
                    </div>
                    <div>I first discovered Mitch’s work when I was an undergraduate student finishing my degree at
                        UCLA. Mitch gave a lecture on kinetic typography and I was blown away by Mitch’s unique
                        approach. He was thinking about typography the same way that many musicians think about their
                        instrument. Typography for Mitch was about the input and the process. Since then I’ve looked up
                        to his work tremendously and have given his talks and lectures as part of the supplemental
                        material I give to students when teaching motion design. For the mix that comes with this
                        publication, Mitch contributed a piece of his original jazz music titled <span
                            class="italic-text">Resolution</span> which I felt
                        complimented the interview well. </div>

                    <div>Noise is interesting because it’s almost impossible to clearly define. For instance, there are
                        noise algorithms, psychological noise, noise music, etc. Some similarities might be this idea of
                        the unpredictable, but it’s open to interpretation. One example would be a noise generator, and
                        the key idea is the unpredictable nature of the algorithm. </div>
                    <div>I know you are a jazz musician as well as a visual designer, and jazz specifically has a unique
                        angle on noise, because of the improv nature of the medium. What are your thoughts on noise,
                        both as a musician and as a designer? </div>

                    <div>Noise is the particles and waves that I’m being inundated with. It is actual atoms moving in
                        the air that our ears respond to. So it is something that is felt by our ears. Maybe that’s more
                        of a physics definition. But that’s the same thing musically. Our ears are dealing with
                        something harmonically or in dissonance. It essentially depends on how the waves are lining up
                        within our ears and whether that’s pleasing or not, as it’s the organization of those atoms or
                        particles we’re reacting to that constitutes noise in its multitude of forms. </div>
                    <div>Musically, that’s why we have scales and harmonics, because that’s tuned to human hearing.
                        We’ve developed whole theories around certain chords, etc. And then, huge art forms have been
                        developed because of those theories that are present in music in general, whether that’s
                        composition, jazz, classical, etc. It’s wild to think that essentially, at a certain point, we
                        were cavemen. Then we created this massive language that tries to define sound in a certain way.

                        What do you think about visual noise? DIA has been posting some work recently of textural
                        elements that some would call noise. How does visual noise influence you as a designer?
                    </div>

                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="interview-speaker">
                <div class="interview-speaker-label">MP</div>
                <div class="interview-speaker-text-second">
                    <div>It’s pretty much a visual direct translation. If you think of things that are more harmonic or
                        melodic, there is more organization in the rhythm of what’s happening visually. There’s a system
                        there. There’s some sort of pattern that’s happening.</div>
                    <div>If you’re familiar with working in 3D software or generative design, you can play with
                        different noise parameters to create a certain feeling out of the work being more symmetrical,
                        asymmetrical, and random. That’s essentially the same as if I’m playing with waveforms on a
                        synthesizer01 to develop a sound. It’s just the visual version of it. I see them directly as a
                        one-to-one equal. It’s the visual translation of how we see things. Although in a design sense,
                        it’s more abstract, and musically, it’s a little easier to understand. If I’m creating a visual
                        system or visual identity, it’s more complex than something like a saw wave on a synthesizer.
                        But we’re still getting at the same thing, pattern recognition and development.</div>

                    <div>
                        In your interviews, you describe yourself as a musician first and then a designer. In many ways,
                        I think of myself in the same way. Being a musician has translated into the way I think about
                        design work. For instance, if I have an After Effects file or a Processing sketch, it feels like
                        I’m playing an instrument.

                    </div>
                    <div>There’s a quote from the professor Sister Corita Kent in her <span class="italic-text">Ten
                            Rules for Students and Teachers</span>. Rule number 8 says, “Don’t try to create and analyze
                        at the same time. They are different processes.”</div>
                    <div>DIA’s process is described as input → improv or experimentation → output. You’re a jazz
                        pianist, and part of playing jazz is creating music in the moment and not having time to
                        analyze. Can you speak about the difference between making something and then analyzing it?
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>



            <div class="interview-speaker">
                <div class="interview-speaker-label">MP</div>
                <div class="interview-speaker-text-second">
                    <div>From a creative standpoint, that’s the ultimate goal. To find a space where you can freely
                        create without criticism. And if you’re coming from a music standpoint, especially in jazz, it’s
                        crucial that you don’t think too much about what you’re playing. You’re reacting to the moment
                        in time. It forces you to be in that space. Therefore because I’m a musician first, it allows me
                        to get into a sort of psychological space, if I’m iterating in design or working on art.</div>
                    <div>There’s another quote I go to from studying Eastern Philosophy and Zen in college. “Analysis
                        leads to paralysis.” And it’s true. As soon as you start to compare something you’re doing to
                        others, or you’re worried about some technical aspect when you’re making work, it freezes the
                        flow of creativity, and that is an extremely important thing.</div>
                    <div>I talk about the input, and output, before and after. But that “before” is the practice. That’s
                        the time when you work everything you need to before it’s time to get down and make something.
                        That’s your taste, your intuition, all that stuff that goes into just how you react to things.
                    </div>
                    <div>That voice in your mind that is providing critical thoughts should ultimately vanish during
                        that point of the best creative moment. As a musician, it’s easier to do that. With design, it’s
                        harder because you can be in a judgment mode if you make a composition. The flow of time during
                        music performance isn’t there. So that needs to be forced. It’s easier to see, “Oh, it’s not
                        working.” But there are other ways to iterate in a certain way that gets you through some of
                        those roadblocks. </div>
                    <div>With students, I deal with all of these things. I tell them, rather than trying to move shit
                        around on a poster to make it look good, just make a hundred posters fast. You’re going to
                        discover a few in there that have what you were looking for because you weren’t thinking too
                        much about it. You’re just getting in the flow, just making stuff rather than analyzing and
                        trying to make it perfect all the time. It never works. You’re never going to hit that “thing”
                        if you’re trying to analyze it. </div>
                    <div>So I think what Sister Corita Kent said is spot on. But that’s hard. It’s a difficult thing to
                        do.</div>

                        Teaching is fascinating because you have to treat every individual student as an individual
                        person. I can’t apply a methodology in a universal way over everyone. I have to react to each
                        person differently, feel them out, and see what’s going to make them tick or not. So it does
                        require a very intimate understanding or relationship to be developed with the student. And even
                        if you have a large class, you still have to do it. There are no shortcuts. And it requires an
                        incredible amount
                        of patience.
                    </div>
                    <div>Everyone’s skills are different, their interests are different. So it forces you to have to get
                        to know the person well and to work with them in a way that’s going to make them feel excited
                        about doing the work, and then make the work related to stuff they’re interested in. We can all
                        make good design and typography but ultimately, that’s just design. I try to ask students, what
                        else are you interested in? What other things can get you pumped up about a design project? For
                        instance, if you’re into food, music, or photography, find what’s interesting to you, and then
                        merge that into your design work. It ultimately becomes more personal, and more interesting.
                    </div>
                    <div>Patience is key. Even with the team at DIA, it’s just how we work together. Everybody is very
                        different. It’s understanding how to support the strengths of the individual as much as
                        possible, to give the best performance, to get them to the space where they can not be critical
                        of themselves and make work. That’s the role of a teacher, and it is very similar to the role of
                        a creative director. You’re just trying to create an atmosphere for people to do the best they
                        can.</div>

                        That’s amazing, thank you. During some of your public lectures, you talk about the hundreds of
                        outputs for a project DIA will create before deciding on which ones to show clients. There’s
                        this huge array of different types of graphic forms and ways to treat type and movement.</div>
                    <div> What’s the process of deciding what sticks after living in this creative flow? How do you
                        treat
                        being analytical? And at what point is the work <span class="italic-text">finished</span>?

                    <div>It depends on the client and the project. I don’t want to oversimplify things, but let’s say
                        that there are two client types. There are branding jobs for clients that have little
                        understanding of the process and you do have to do a lot more education. You have to mock stuff
                        up. You have to make stuff look finished. Then, there are clients with their internal creative
                        team.</div>
                    <div>
                        In our case, a lot of our projects have creative teams on the other side. Most of the big tech
                        companies we work with have creative departments with really talented people. So it gives us the
                        luxury of being more open. In that case, we’re very transparent. It’s like, “Hey here are some
                        buckets and territories of exploration.” Those creative teams know the company better than we
                        do. So they can see how these things could potentially be applied. Then, we just have a larger
                        discussion over a big body of work that consists mostly of sketches, little iterations, and
                        unpolished pieces. But also we have trust in them that they can see that these things can come
                        to life into a very
                        practical matter.
                    </div>
                    <div>If you don’t have the luxury of a creative team to work with on the client side, we have to
                        internally decide; “Okay, here are the directions out of this mess that we feel the strongest
                        about.” Less than a day before the presentation of the actual work needs to go, that decision is
                        made. So what we want to do is iterate right up until we don’t have enough time to mock stuff
                        up. And then, really, it’s very fast. Collectively we decide which ones are interesting, and put
                        them into a presentation. There are never a ton of meetings. All of the decisions happen right
                        before the mockup stage, because essentially what you’re forcing yourself to do is to just let
                        your gut decide.</div>
                    <div>If you give yourself too much time, you start to overthink it. It just needs to feel good. And
                        those decisions happen quickly. If you have technical chops and good typographic skills, it’s
                        pretty easy to make good-looking stuff. But it’s not easy to make things impactful or strong,
                        because you’d have to go through an iterative process to get to that point. We can always fall
                        back on a grid and some good typefaces. But even there, the selection of a typeface is crucial,
                        you go through thousands of options before one feels right. Ultimately though, final decisions
                        need to be quick for it to feel right. </div>

                        Thanks, that makes sense. I’ve seen two different versions of outputs that DIA gives clients
                        (but I’m sure there’s more.) One output is the more “classic” approach, where DIA gives clients
                        finished rendered videos, or templates to make and create these videos. The other output
                        involves creating custom tools, which then the client uses to create their work.</div>
                    <div> I’m thinking specifically about the work you did for Space 10, where you gave the client a
                        tool that can render custom videos for assets. The tool you created reminded me of a
                        synthesizer, where there are certain parameters that a musician needs to be able to change to
                        create a specific sound, but there are also parameters that the manufacturer made concrete,
                        meaning the musician cannot change the function.
                    </div>
                    <div>Can you speak a little bit about creating tools for clients, the limitations that you set on
                        those tools, and how much flexibility you give someone versus how much is contained?</div>

                    <div>Design systems are essentially a set of rules and parameters. If you look at brand guidelines,
                        for example, you could theoretically turn that into code and create a system that can generate
                        the majority of the stuff. This has been practically and theoretically in my head even ten years
                        ago. I was thinking, “Why do we have 200 pages of shit in a PDF when you could write code to
                        automate most of these tasks?” It’s all kind of ridiculous that that’s still the norm.
                    </div>

                    <div>The design that I find interesting asks the question, “What can you do a lot with... if you
                        only have a little amount of stuff?” For instance, if we just have well-considered typography,
                        we don’t need to add illustration, photography, or art direction. We don’t need all of that
                        because if we can do a lot with a little and then apply certain rules to that, then it does
                        generate a consistent aesthetic. </div>
                    <div>There’s this idea of a system that’s in mind: “A + B + C = this.” Then you decide, okay, these
                        are the things you don’t want the client to change, and these are the things that you give them
                        allowance to change. We’re trying to find where the flexibility in the system still feels
                        consistent when it’s generated but also dynamic and interesting. After that, it’s really about
                        setting guardrails. So it’s us testing and playing to see how much freedom we allow the system
                        to have before it breaks and becomes abstract. Limitations on typography and color are the two
                        things that you can lock systems down with. For example, suppose you set limitations on color or
                        x-height on a typeface but leave everything else open. In that case, you’ll still generate some
                        consistency through the exports because you’ve already set
                        those limitations. </div>
                    <div>We find that balance through testing. It starts with prototyping. We have extensive experience
                        using 3D and animation software. So, we can create renders and create the basis for what a
                        generative tool can look like. I can make three different renders, with variations on specific
                        parameters such as type size, leading, and color. After that, you can apply those variables to
                        code and create a more accessible and playful system. Some fun examples include mapping it to a
                        camera, putting images to effect it, and using noise; it can all become endless once you have
                        the core idea sorted.</div>
                    <div>It’s a synthesizer, really, essentially, that is what it is. Export. Hit render. Make a poster.
                        It’s fast. It’s hard to get there. But then there’s practicality to it. When talking about
                        client work and branding, branding is a production problem for big companies because they have
                        this design system and need to produce it. And they need it done fast. Internal design teams
                        aren’t trying to create a new challenge every time. They’re trying to get an ad out quickly
                        because they are usually strapped for time. So, if you have tools or templates and things built
                        for them, it makes their life a lot easier, and it’s much more valuable than supplying a large
                        PDF to decipher.</div>

                        this, we can handle the ebb and flow of work and the cycles that come with our line of work.
                        When we have downtime, we don’t have to seek new business like big agencies actively do because
                        we are small and have very little overhead. So, during downtime, we support research and
                        development when we’re not working on client projects.

                        methods. Right now, we’re playing with a lot of OpenGL shaders and experimenting with new
                        languages outside of JavaScript. And for me, it’s the same thing. I’m working on typefaces and
                        then using those as a place to explore new techniques, whether it’s in 3D After Effects or other
                        animation software. So, I always play with typefaces, even when I’m not working on client work.

                    On that topic, you’re also a type designer, having started the foundry Monkey Type. Can you speak a
                    little bit about that and how you got into that? Also, as someone who’s so well known for their work
                    in motion design and animation, what is your mental process for designing a typeface? Are you
                    already thinking of how it is going to move? </div>

                    <div>When I was studying, I was super interested in being able to draw typography. Looking at the
                        work of DIA, the typographic component is probably the most crucial part of our projects.
                        Typography reigns supreme over everything else. It’s one of the most critical decisions on our
                        projects. Creating my typefaces was just a natural progression; I can’t find what I’m looking
                        for aesthetically in the millions of fonts, so why can’t I draw my own?
                    </div>

                    <div>That was a question that started in 2016. I drew Banana Grotesque then and it was finished in
                        2018. Monkey Type started as sort of a joke. This other designer based in New York named Philipp
                        Hubert was eating with me in Chinatown and we were just like, “Let’s call this type foundry
                        Monkey Type.” He was just joking but I took it more seriously and was like, “Yeah, fuck it.
                        We’re going to do this.”
                    </div>
                    <div>Over time, I have developed twelve fully finished typefaces and many more in the works,
                        anything from serifs to sans serifs, etc. All of this has come out of trying to find something
                        that doesn’t exist in other libraries or catalogs of other foundries. On top of that, I moved to
                        Switzerland. And I realized, there’s a whole different approach to type in this country where
                        it’s so fundamental to the graphic designer that it’s in the fundamentals of their studies.
                        People are drawing typefaces just for a poster, which I think is almost ridiculous. But it’s
                        natural that the designer is also the type designer in Switzerland. </div>
                    <div>I found it interesting because from the start to the finish of the work, you can be in charge
                        of the entire development process. Then I kind of took it upon myself to just learn. I was
                        teaching at ECAL and I just bothered the type design teachers for the entire time I was there
                        and showed them stuff. Aurèle Sack was around, the guys from Lineto were around, and the guys
                        from All Caps were teacher’s assistants at the time. So I was like “Hey, guys, check out this
                        shit. What do you think? Give me notes…?” I was acting like a curious student the whole time
                        even though I was there to teach. That experience added another level of refinement to my type
                        design practice. </div>

                    <div>If you listen to some of my talks around 2017–18, I said this would be the norm. People were
                        rejecting it and calling it trendy, but I was stating that this would be normal because our mode
                        of communication is all digital. It’s on your phone. So, it’s just natural that graphic design
                        transfers itself into new mediums. The history of graphic design is essentially connected to how
                        type is being printed, and this is no different. </div>
                    <div>As far as the future goes, AI will have a tremendous impact on it. When we were working with
                        Squarespace, we started to develop generative tools for visuals. Now, it has become more normal
                        to create these sorts of tools. The automation of these animation tasks is going to be easier
                        and more democratized. When we develop tools for clients like Space 10, it’s democratizing many
                        skills that are very difficult to do if you are an After Effects animator or Cinema 4D person.

                    <div>
                        The role of creative direction is going to be interesting. Suppose I don’t understand aspects
                        that go into a project, such as music, type design, animation, etc. It may be challenging for me
                        to train AI to develop something that’s going to work. But if you have this understanding of all
                        these things going into it, it’s easy to talk to Chat GPT and have you develop a piece of
                        software that’s doing something for you because you know the language, you understand the logic
                        of the code. You have this fundamental understanding of these things. Then, it’s easier to work
                        with AI to develop stuff. I think the future is that rather than having a team of specialists,
                        there will be more AI integration in creating
                        these things.
                    </div>
                    <div>I worked in commercial motion graphics from 2005 to 2013 before we became more of a branding
                        studio. I have a lot of friends in that field who are doing 3D modeling and animation. If you
                        saw the Sora videos that are coming out from Open AI, they’re all fucking freaked out. And
                        rightfully so, because there is a sense of the craftsman of the work that will start to be
                        automated. But there always is going to be the creative director. The taste and the input are
                        always going to be necessary. Someone will have to control it and train it to do what you need
                        to do. So, to me, that’s the future of typography. That’s the future of graphic design.</div>

                    <div>From what I’ve seen, illustration and image generation will get hit first because, from what I

                        moving much slower than image creation. Just seeing what’s happening in the last three to five
                        years, it’s hard to know what it will look like ten years from now. It might be simple: you type
                        in a prompt with some references, and you can generate any type of work. It’s kind of scary to

                        with everyone carrying around a camera. What are your thoughts on the interactive element of
                        typography? What does that look like in the future? </div>

                        I think it will take a long time to adopt those formats. Also, though, I didn’t grow up on the
                        screen. I got Facebook right in college, so my perspective might be different. I’ve always been
                        critical of some of this stuff. Still, as generations continue to integrate the screen right out
                        of the womb, it might feel more natural for future generations to interact with a design like
                        that.

                    <div>When I was younger, Herbie was the person who got me into studying jazz. The album
                        <span class="italic-text">Thrust</span> was the one. <span
                            class="italic-text">Headhunters</span> is a little more well-known, but
                        <span class="italic-text">Thrust</span> was the one for me. It’s live recorded in Japan. I was
                        in high school when I
                        heard it, and I just thought, this is fucking amazing. The sound of the Fender Rhodes created
                        the funk and the feel that took jazz out into a new space for me. I realized this is what I want
                        to figure out how to do. Weather Report and the album <span class="italic-text">Heavy
                            Weather</span> was also highly
                        inspirational. I was 16 or 17 then and loved people like Jaco Pastorius. I was really into that
                        fusion of funk and jazz. I also went to New Orleans and studied music there while finishing my
                        design degree. New Orleans is the motherland of funk and jazz. So I just got educated in all of
                        it.

                    such as LTJ Bukem and Ronny Size. That’s excellent music to listen to when you’re doing type design,
                    it’s like fucking like 180 BPM, and you’re working on beziers, it’s great. Even now, I am just
                    discovering some more straight garage house music or stuff on SoundCloud because you have so much
                    access to music. Now you find stations of people you like and can constantly discover new things. So
                    I’m genre-less. I have a core taste for soul, funk, and jazz. But I love it all. There’s also a lot
                    of stuff coming out of the UK, such as Kamal Williams and Yussef Dayes. I find many of the UK scene
                    mixes house and techno with jazz influences interesting.

                    Another huge influence of mine is Wayne Shorter. I find his spiritual aspect fascinating, especially
                    his Buddhist practice and how that’s impacted his creativity. As we mentioned earlier, this idea of
                    analysis leads to paralysis. A lot of this stuff all follows into the same kind of space. It’s just
                    a way of life and a way of being. His quartet, which I saw live a few times, was Brian Blade, Wayne
                    Shorter, John Patitucci, and Danilo Pérez. The live performance just blew you out of your fucking
                    seat. It was just pure, intense improvisational energy for an hour. You’re just holding under your
                    seat like you’re on a rocket ship, and then you’re like, “holy fuck, what has happened to me.” That
                    was amazing. And I’m not sure what happened. It was so intense and so awesome.

You have to learn the design craft and study everything, but there’s a parallel between making yourself feel comfortable and happy and synergizing those things.</div>
                    <div>The second and perhaps most important thing is finding inspiration for design outside of strictly design. For instance, music drove my design practice. It drove how I thought about design since day one, and it continues to be a source of inspiration for the work. Having an interest that parallels to draw inspiration from will make the work more interesting and personal. And then it doesn’t get boring. You’re always finding ways of bringing these things and mixing them. Whether that’s poetry, writing, or journalism, finding other interests and then seeing how that can fuse with the technical side of design makes it more interesting.</div>
                    <div>You can’t just love design—I guess some people can—but there’s always inspiration. Ask yourself, what was your inspiration? Why did this person make it this way? There’s got to be more than just a beautiful form. There are richer narratives and personal stories to draw on. The people we think are masters were all probably finding inspiration and sources from an array of stuff that had nothing to do with a chair or a typeface. </div>
                    <div>So those are my two things. But it’s hard. It’s getting to know yourself. It’s tough to do when you’re young, on social media, and comparing yourself to others. But questions to ask are things like what makes you tick? What do you like? What defines your taste in things? It’s hard to define, and it takes a lot of trial and error and putting yourself out of your comfort zone. It’s just trying, testing, and being okay with falling down a few times.</div>
