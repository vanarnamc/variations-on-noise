                    <div>Mitch Paone is the creative director of New York and Chamonix-based creative agency DIA Studio.
                        DIA Specializes in corporate and cultural visual identity systems, graphic design, and
                        typography. DIA’s signature use of motion and generative tools has led to significant
                        collaborations with clients such as Squarespace, Balenciaga, Pinterest, Nike, Saint Laurent,
                        Apple, and many more. Additionally, Mitch lectures and leads workshops at conferences and
                        universities worldwide. Most notably, Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK), Ecole cantonale
                        d’art de Lausanne (ECAL), Pratt Institute and the School for Visual Arts in New York. </div>
                    <div>
                        Mitch recently held positions at Haute école d’art et de design, Genève (HEAD – Genève) and The
                        Royal Academy of Art, The Hague (KABK). In his courses, he implemented DIA’s creative process
                        into the academic curriculum, specifically focusing on motion and generative tools in a graphic
                        design context. Mitch and DIA studio partner Meg Donohoe are AGI (Alliance Graphique
                        Internationale) members. Mitch is also a performing jazz pianist, composer, and type designer
                        beyond DIA and academic endeavors.
                    </div>
                    <div>I first discovered Mitch’s work when I was an undergraduate student finishing my degree at
                        UCLA. Mitch gave a lecture on kinetic typography and I was blown away by Mitch’s unique
                        approach. He was thinking about typography the same way that many musicians think about their
                        instrument. Typography for Mitch was about the input and the process. Since then I’ve looked up
                        to his work tremendously and have given his talks and lectures as part of the supplemental
                        material I give to students when teaching motion design. For the mix that comes with this
                        publication, Mitch contributed a piece of his original jazz music titled <span
                            class="italic-text">Resolution</span> which I felt
                        complimented the interview well. </div>

                    <div>Noise is interesting because it’s almost impossible to clearly define. For instance, there are
                        noise algorithms, psychological noise, noise music, etc. Some similarities might be this idea of
                        the unpredictable, but it’s open to interpretation. One example would be a noise generator, and
                        the key idea is the unpredictable nature of the algorithm. </div>
                    <div>I know you are a jazz musician as well as a visual designer, and jazz specifically has a unique
                        angle on noise, because of the improv nature of the medium. What are your thoughts on noise,
                        both as a musician and as a designer? </div>

                    <div>Noise is the particles and waves that I’m being inundated with. It is actual atoms moving in
                        the air that our ears respond to. So it is something that is felt by our ears. Maybe that’s more
                        of a physics definition. But that’s the same thing musically. Our ears are dealing with
                        something harmonically or in dissonance. It essentially depends on how the waves are lining up
                        within our ears and whether that’s pleasing or not, as it’s the organization of those atoms or
                        particles we’re reacting to that constitutes noise in its multitude of forms. </div>
                    <div>Musically, that’s why we have scales and harmonics, because that’s tuned to human hearing.
                        We’ve developed whole theories around certain chords, etc. And then, huge art forms have been
                        developed because of those theories that are present in music in general, whether that’s
                        composition, jazz, classical, etc. It’s wild to think that essentially, at a certain point, we
                        were cavemen. Then we created this massive language that tries to define sound in a certain way.

                        What do you think about visual noise? DIA has been posting some work recently of textural
                        elements that some would call noise. How does visual noise influence you as a designer?
                    </div>

                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="interview-speaker">
                <div class="interview-speaker-label">MP</div>
                <div class="interview-speaker-text-second">
                    <div>It’s pretty much a visual direct translation. If you think of things that are more harmonic or
                        melodic, there is more organization in the rhythm of what’s happening visually. There’s a system
                        there. There’s some sort of pattern that’s happening.</div>
                    <div>If you’re familiar with working in 3D software or generative design, you can play with
                        different noise parameters to create a certain feeling out of the work being more symmetrical,
                        asymmetrical, and random. That’s essentially the same as if I’m playing with waveforms on a
                        synthesizer01 to develop a sound. It’s just the visual version of it. I see them directly as a
                        one-to-one equal. It’s the visual translation of how we see things. Although in a design sense,
                        it’s more abstract, and musically, it’s a little easier to understand. If I’m creating a visual
                        system or visual identity, it’s more complex than something like a saw wave on a synthesizer.
                        But we’re still getting at the same thing, pattern recognition and development.</div>

                    <div>
                        In your interviews, you describe yourself as a musician first and then a designer. In many ways,
                        I think of myself in the same way. Being a musician has translated into the way I think about
                        design work. For instance, if I have an After Effects file or a Processing sketch, it feels like
                        I’m playing an instrument.

                    </div>
                    <div>There’s a quote from the professor Sister Corita Kent in her <span class="italic-text">Ten
                            Rules for Students and Teachers</span>. Rule number 8 says, “Don’t try to create and analyze
                        at the same time. They are different processes.”</div>
                    <div>DIA’s process is described as input → improv or experimentation → output. You’re a jazz
                        pianist, and part of playing jazz is creating music in the moment and not having time to
                        analyze. Can you speak about the difference between making something and then analyzing it?
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>



            <div class="interview-speaker">
                <div class="interview-speaker-label">MP</div>
                <div class="interview-speaker-text-second">
                    <div>From a creative standpoint, that’s the ultimate goal. To find a space where you can freely
                        create without criticism. And if you’re coming from a music standpoint, especially in jazz, it’s
                        crucial that you don’t think too much about what you’re playing. You’re reacting to the moment
                        in time. It forces you to be in that space. Therefore because I’m a musician first, it allows me
                        to get into a sort of psychological space, if I’m iterating in design or working on art.</div>
                    <div>There’s another quote I go to from studying Eastern Philosophy and Zen in college. “Analysis
                        leads to paralysis.” And it’s true. As soon as you start to compare something you’re doing to
                        others, or you’re worried about some technical aspect when you’re making work, it freezes the
                        flow of creativity, and that is an extremely important thing.</div>
                    <div>I talk about the input, and output, before and after. But that “before” is the practice. That’s
                        the time when you work everything you need to before it’s time to get down and make something.
                        That’s your taste, your intuition, all that stuff that goes into just how you react to things.
                    </div>
                    <div>That voice in your mind that is providing critical thoughts should ultimately vanish during
                        that point of the best creative moment. As a musician, it’s easier to do that. With design, it’s
                        harder because you can be in a judgment mode if you make a composition. The flow of time during
                        music performance isn’t there. So that needs to be forced. It’s easier to see, “Oh, it’s not
                        working.” But there are other ways to iterate in a certain way that gets you through some of
                        those roadblocks. </div>
                    <div>With students, I deal with all of these things. I tell them, rather than trying to move shit
                        around on a poster to make it look good, just make a hundred posters fast. You’re going to
                        discover a few in there that have what you were looking for because you weren’t thinking too
                        much about it. You’re just getting in the flow, just making stuff rather than analyzing and
                        trying to make it perfect all the time. It never works. You’re never going to hit that “thing”
                        if you’re trying to analyze it. </div>
                    <div>So I think what Sister Corita Kent said is spot on. But that’s hard. It’s a difficult thing to
                        do.</div>

                        Teaching is fascinating because you have to treat every individual student as an individual
                        person. I can’t apply a methodology in a universal way over everyone. I have to react to each
                        person differently, feel them out, and see what’s going to make them tick or not. So it does
                        require a very intimate understanding or relationship to be developed with the student. And even
                        if you have a large class, you still have to do it. There are no shortcuts. And it requires an
                        incredible amount
                        of patience.
                    </div>
                    <div>Everyone’s skills are different, their interests are different. So it forces you to have to get
                        to know the person well and to work with them in a way that’s going to make them feel excited
                        about doing the work, and then make the work related to stuff they’re interested in. We can all
                        make good design and typography but ultimately, that’s just design. I try to ask students, what
                        else are you interested in? What other things can get you pumped up about a design project? For
                        instance, if you’re into food, music, or photography, find what’s interesting to you, and then
                        merge that into your design work. It ultimately becomes more personal, and more interesting.
                    </div>
                    <div>Patience is key. Even with the team at DIA, it’s just how we work together. Everybody is very
                        different. It’s understanding how to support the strengths of the individual as much as
                        possible, to give the best performance, to get them to the space where they can not be critical
                        of themselves and make work. That’s the role of a teacher, and it is very similar to the role of
                        a creative director. You’re just trying to create an atmosphere for people to do the best they
                        can.</div>

                        That’s amazing, thank you. During some of your public lectures, you talk about the hundreds of
                        outputs for a project DIA will create before deciding on which ones to show clients. There’s
                        this huge array of different types of graphic forms and ways to treat type and movement.</div>
                    <div> What’s the process of deciding what sticks after living in this creative flow? How do you
                        treat
                        being analytical? And at what point is the work <span class="italic-text">finished</span>?

                    <div>It depends on the client and the project. I don’t want to oversimplify things, but let’s say
                        that there are two client types. There are branding jobs for clients that have little
                        understanding of the process and you do have to do a lot more education. You have to mock stuff
                        up. You have to make stuff look finished. Then, there are clients with their internal creative
                        team.</div>
                    <div>
                        In our case, a lot of our projects have creative teams on the other side. Most of the big tech
                        companies we work with have creative departments with really talented people. So it gives us the
                        luxury of being more open. In that case, we’re very transparent. It’s like, “Hey here are some
                        buckets and territories of exploration.” Those creative teams know the company better than we
                        do. So they can see how these things could potentially be applied. Then, we just have a larger
                        discussion over a big body of work that consists mostly of sketches, little iterations, and
                        unpolished pieces. But also we have trust in them that they can see that these things can come
                        to life into a very
                        practical matter.
                    </div>
                    <div>If you don’t have the luxury of a creative team to work with on the client side, we have to
                        internally decide; “Okay, here are the directions out of this mess that we feel the strongest
                        about.” Less than a day before the presentation of the actual work needs to go, that decision is
                        made. So what we want to do is iterate right up until we don’t have enough time to mock stuff
                        up. And then, really, it’s very fast. Collectively we decide which ones are interesting, and put
                        them into a presentation. There are never a ton of meetings. All of the decisions happen right
                        before the mockup stage, because essentially what you’re forcing yourself to do is to just let
                        your gut decide.</div>
                    <div>If you give yourself too much time, you start to overthink it. It just needs to feel good. And
                        those decisions happen quickly. If you have technical chops and good typographic skills, it’s
                        pretty easy to make good-looking stuff. But it’s not easy to make things impactful or strong,
                        because you’d have to go through an iterative process to get to that point. We can always fall
                        back on a grid and some good typefaces. But even there, the selection of a typeface is crucial,
                        you go through thousands of options before one feels right. Ultimately though, final decisions
                        need to be quick for it to feel right. </div>

                        Thanks, that makes sense. I’ve seen two different versions of outputs that DIA gives clients
                        (but I’m sure there’s more.) One output is the more “classic” approach, where DIA gives clients
                        finished rendered videos, or templates to make and create these videos. The other output
                        involves creating custom tools, which then the client uses to create their work.</div>
                    <div> I’m thinking specifically about the work you did for Space 10, where you gave the client a
                        tool that can render custom videos for assets. The tool you created reminded me of a
                        synthesizer, where there are certain parameters that a musician needs to be able to change to
                        create a specific sound, but there are also parameters that the manufacturer made concrete,
                        meaning the musician cannot change the function.
                    </div>
                    <div>Can you speak a little bit about creating tools for clients, the limitations that you set on
                        those tools, and how much flexibility you give someone versus how much is contained?</div>

                    <div>Design systems are essentially a set of rules and parameters. If you look at brand guidelines,
                        for example, you could theoretically turn that into code and create a system that can generate
                        the majority of the stuff. This has been practically and theoretically in my head even ten years
                        ago. I was thinking, “Why do we have 200 pages of shit in a PDF when you could write code to
                        automate most of these tasks?” It’s all kind of ridiculous that that’s still the norm.
                    </div>

                    <div>The design that I find interesting asks the question, “What can you do a lot with... if you
                        only have a little amount of stuff?” For instance, if we just have well-considered typography,
                        we don’t need to add illustration, photography, or art direction. We don’t need all of that
                        because if we can do a lot with a little and then apply certain rules to that, then it does
                        generate a consistent aesthetic. </div>
                    <div>There’s this idea of a system that’s in mind: “A + B + C = this.” Then you decide, okay, these
                        are the things you don’t want the client to change, and these are the things that you give them
                        allowance to change. We’re trying to find where the flexibility in the system still feels
                        consistent when it’s generated but also dynamic and interesting. After that, it’s really about
                        setting guardrails. So it’s us testing and playing to see how much freedom we allow the system
                        to have before it breaks and becomes abstract. Limitations on typography and color are the two
                        things that you can lock systems down with. For example, suppose you set limitations on color or
                        x-height on a typeface but leave everything else open. In that case, you’ll still generate some
                        consistency through the exports because you’ve already set
                        those limitations. </div>
                    <div>We find that balance through testing. It starts with prototyping. We have extensive experience
                        using 3D and animation software. So, we can create renders and create the basis for what a
                        generative tool can look like. I can make three different renders, with variations on specific
                        parameters such as type size, leading, and color. After that, you can apply those variables to
                        code and create a more accessible and playful system. Some fun examples include mapping it to a
                        camera, putting images to effect it, and using noise; it can all become endless once you have
                        the core idea sorted.</div>
                    <div>It’s a synthesizer, really, essentially, that is what it is. Export. Hit render. Make a poster.
                        It’s fast. It’s hard to get there. But then there’s practicality to it. When talking about
                        client work and branding, branding is a production problem for big companies because they have
                        this design system and need to produce it. And they need it done fast. Internal design teams
                        aren’t trying to create a new challenge every time. They’re trying to get an ad out quickly
                        because they are usually strapped for time. So, if you have tools or templates and things built
                        for them, it makes their life a lot easier, and it’s much more valuable than supplying a large
                        PDF to decipher.</div>

                    One of the most interesting things about DIA to me is the research aspect of the company. Can you

                        this, we can handle the ebb and flow of work and the cycles that come with our line of work.
                        When we have downtime, we don’t have to seek new business like big agencies actively do because
                        we are small and have very little overhead. So, during downtime, we support research and
                        development when we’re not working on client projects.

                        methods. Right now, we’re playing with a lot of OpenGL shaders and experimenting with new
                        languages outside of JavaScript. And for me, it’s the same thing. I’m working on typefaces and
                        then using those as a place to explore new techniques, whether it’s in 3D After Effects or other
                        animation software. So, I always play with typefaces, even when I’m not working on client work.

                    little bit about that and how you got into that? Also, as someone who’s so well known for their work
                    in motion design and animation, what is your mental process for designing a typeface? Are you

                    <div>When I was studying, I was super interested in being able to draw typography. Looking at the
                        work of DIA, the typographic component is probably the most crucial part of our projects.
                        Typography reigns supreme over everything else. It’s one of the most critical decisions on our
                        projects. Creating my typefaces was just a natural progression; I can’t find what I’m looking
                        for aesthetically in the millions of fonts, so why can’t I draw my own?
                    </div>

                    <div>That was a question that started in 2016. I drew Banana Grotesque then and it was finished in
                        2018. Monkey Type started as sort of a joke. This other designer based in New York named Philipp
                        Hubert was eating with me in Chinatown and we were just like, “Let’s call this type foundry
                        Monkey Type.” He was just joking but I took it more seriously and was like, “Yeah, fuck it.
                        We’re going to do this.”
                    </div>
                    <div>Over time, I have developed twelve fully finished typefaces and many more in the works,
                        anything from serifs to sans serifs, etc. All of this has come out of trying to find something
                        that doesn’t exist in other libraries or catalogs of other foundries. On top of that, I moved to
                        Switzerland. And I realized, there’s a whole different approach to type in this country where
                        it’s so fundamental to the graphic designer that it’s in the fundamentals of their studies.
                        People are drawing typefaces just for a poster, which I think is almost ridiculous. But it’s
                        natural that the designer is also the type designer in Switzerland. </div>
                    <div>I found it interesting because from the start to the finish of the work, you can be in charge
                        of the entire development process. Then I kind of took it upon myself to just learn. I was
                        teaching at ECAL and I just bothered the type design teachers for the entire time I was there
                        and showed them stuff. Aurèle Sack was around, the guys from Lineto were around, and the guys
                        from All Caps were teacher’s assistants at the time. So I was like “Hey, guys, check out this
                        shit. What do you think? Give me notes…?” I was acting like a curious student the whole time
                        even though I was there to teach. That experience added another level of refinement to my type
                        design practice. </div>

                    <div>A tee works when its message penetrates a viewer’s image of the world. The arrangement has to
                        tell
                        a coherent story, but it requires new pictorial reading that’s nonlinear and more ambiguous. New
                        intentional relationships between images need to be interpreted. Our moment of “noise” (as
                        discussed
                        earlier in the text) has conditioned us to experience time polychronically the ability to attend
                        multiple events simultaniously. The multiple significance of signs on
                        top of signs is becoming a comfortable pastime. For most it still requires a ‘double take’
                        taking a
                        viewer out of automatic perception and
                        activating thought.</div>
                    <div>This is the language of film and also of lowly advertising, the front page of newspapers,
                        19th-century “catchpennies,” ancient illuminated manuscripts, and emblem books from the
                        renaissance
                        (all ancestors of the poster and t-shirt). They share a common literary method: “headline,
                        image,
                        caption.” By tapping into this simple tripartite visual rhythm (bass, strings, vocal in music)
                        one
                        can generate infinite complexity. It’s a starting scheme to be further developed and later
                        turned on
                        its head.</div>

                    <div>Above all the arrangement has to activate the intellectual and emotional, the rational and
                        irrational. What graphics make it onto an object corresponds to its potential for creating
                        situations as a worn sign that activates any of these responses. The content and medium have to
                        be
                        in sync, which means legibility across multiple distances in social settings. If the material is
                        too
                        banal, novel or illegible it has less of a chance for being noticed. This is all obvious. An
                        effective way to generate notice is to meet people where they’re at by showing something at once
                        familiar and unfamiliar, where the new and unknown springs from the already known. Referencing
                        what
                        people already expect from t-shirts (a 70-year history to draw from) can act as a Trojan horse
                        for
                        introducing new forms and ideas. When something’s ’slightly off’ people take notice. A simple
                        “logo
                        flip” is the simplest version of this. Shock is the quickest way to affect someone’s nervous
                        system
                        but it is not sustainable (unless you’re the New York Post) and people are most generous and
                        open to
                        a reading when they’re at ease and understand at least part of a visual puzzle right away. This
                        is
                        also a strategy for building knowledge through constructive links. Tees can then become gateways
                        into the details we have on the website and become a mnemonic device or a kind of emblem of
                        compressed thought — a mental map, a sigil, a tool for reflection and memory. A diagram of
                        complex
                        data that accelerates understanding and reveals routes for deeper exploration. The shirt
                        explodes
                        inwards spiritually and outwards socially.</div>

                    <div>This is a guiding spirit. Mark Fisher talked about this one too. It is so emblematic of this
                        drive
                        we share—to renew the best of the past (here it’s Goldie updating Japan’s “Ghosts” from 1981),
                        bringing it into constellation with the present (Goldie’s Jungle generation of the early 90s).
                        It’s
                        a blueprint for using the past as raw material for making something completely new without
                        diminishing the truth content of the past. A progressive recycling, not impotent melancholic
                        nostalgia. Here the past and present are on equal footing and in symbiotic relation. To produce
                        something like this requires a responsible translation. This doesn’t mean any kind of loyalty or
                        literal translation of the original, but it requires an ability to understand two worlds,
                        multiple
                        perspectives and languages simultaneously and see how and where they fit together to make

                    <div>My path is marked by a very “unofficial” education, a selfeducation first inherited from the
                        surface (popular bourgeois sphere), and later in my teens within alternative spaces like online
                        forums, late 2000s social media, blogs and p2p sites with chat rooms. In those spaces you
                        understand
                        the real potentials of file-sharing combined with discussion (everyone’s library is a unique
                        constellation), which becomes a mode of simultaneous building and sharing—a super productive
                        mode
                        for learning that rivals any “official education.” There you learn to freely express and play
                        with
                        language (before followers existed). What’s missing are any kind of standards for good writing.
                        These contingent spaces are organically constructed instead of casted like a season of the Real
                        World. Engaging with a thousand arguments about why X band is great or X band sucks becomes a
                        fruitful struggle for constructing knowledge (going beyond the immediate subject). </div>

                        (sometimes
                        toxic) people working to discover for themselves what’s good under their own direct control. But
                        these spaces are transient, so the aim since then has been to seek out or develop similar and
                        updated frameworks for continuing to add to this great discussion of what’s valuable
                        (information
                        war). Aesthetics are involved in convincing people why something matters (rhetoric, propaganda).
                        Bridging the URL with the IRL was a next step which led me to self-publishing and design.

                    <div>As my interests evolved beyond music (into design, art, philosophy etc) this method for
                        self-constructing and presenting knowledge continued, but I found the search for good images and
                        media from other disciplines located in a different landscape well protected or unavailable
                        online.
                        Meaning it’s unavailable to most others too. At a certain point of digging you hit proverbial
                        paywalls or an institutional gatekeeper that denies access to quality material that would help
                        improve a growing conception of the world for many. Access denied (due to lack of economic or
                        social
                        capital) requires alternative methods to reach an objective. This involves smuggling — rescuing
                        and
                        liberating what’s been locked up or hidden is the primary action. Teenage experiences of ripping
                        unheard records and uploading them to Soulseek is close to the current method of organizing
                        found
                        material onto ‘objects-to-think-with.’ The movement of mp3s circulating on networks is analogous
                        to
                        shirts moving through city streets: people log-on and log-off, go out and go home — when the

                        is live and shared, information is allowed to flow.</div>

                        to keep doors open: between disciplines, institutions, and to all differing worldviews. Every
                        institution (and person) is determined by what ideas are able to be smuggled in and out of its
                        system. Closed off institutions and specialized individuals are doomed to decay. With open doors
                        and
                        a flow of information, new forms emerge. The internet has given us keys to previously sealed off

                        of
                        being read? Condensed forms don’t have to be of lesser quality or impact. Any medium and tool
                        has
                        the ability to drop its therapeutic or entertainment function and become one in the service of
                        education and socialization. The goal isn’t to replace the academic text, but to lead a person
                        into
                        it that would never encounter it otherwise, and then carry on its ideas as an educational
                        beacon.
                        Tees work as potent tools because they’re in touch with the emotions of modern life—the desire
                        to
                        share signs with hopes of building new associations and knowledge with others through values in
                        common. Illuminating signs unroll into a new use value, newly organized images lead to newly

                        meaningful,
                        surprising interactions mediated by these tools help knowledge stick and generate further
                        inquiry.
                        As long as the ‘official education’ is reserved for a select few, these unofficial objects like
                        Tees
                        will provide a similar temporary scaffolding that ignites a process of interiorizing and
                        socializing
                        knowledge. </div>
